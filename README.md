# Eldenring boss timer

This is an Auto Splitter script that was initially meant to time boss fights.

### Features:
The script displays:
- Current boss fight timer
- Previously recorded time
- Death counter


### How to use:
- Your layout should contain at least a timer, add this script as a Scriptable Auto Splitter that, the other controls will be created automatically
- The timing method should be "Game Time", the script will ask to change it if it's not the case
- Play elddenring, enjoy!
